            <p>Let's say you have a product, a portfolio, or just an idea you want to share with everyone on your
                <em>own</em> website. Before you publish it on the internet, you want to make it look attractive,
                professional, or at least <em>decent</em> to look at.</p>
            <p>What is the <a class="step" data-step="0" href="#content">first thing</a> you need to work on?</p>

        <section id="content">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>The purpose of <strong>design</strong> is to enhance the presentation of the content it's applied to. It
                might sound obvious, but content being the <strong>primary</strong> element of a website, it should not
                be
                established as an afterthought.</p>
            <p>Written content, like the paragraph you're currently reading, makes up for more than 90% of the Web.
                Styling
                this textual content will go a long way.</p>
            <p>Let's assume you've already finalised the content you want to publish and just created an empty
                <code>style.css</code> file, what is the <a class="step" data-step="1" href="#centering">first rule</a>
                you
                can write?</p>
