Found this [gem of a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5thFiWF5TE) while browsing reddit. Instantly takes me back to high school.
The electric guitar, the voice and the lyrics are all ❤️. 

Translating the lyrics below:

<div class="lyric">
Kithey lukkian kithey lukkian
Gallan si eh ankahian
Taenu vekhke taenu vekhke
Ajj eh na jaan rokian
</div>

<div class="translation">
Where do they hide
These words unspoken  
Looking at you
Today they can’t be stopped  
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Shayad maen chup hi rehnda
Duron vekhda kujh na kehnda
Par hasdi si o foka
Dendi khud nu dhokha
</div>

<div class="translation">
Maybe I’d have remained silent
Looked at her from afar and said nothing
But her laughter was fake
She was but deluding herself
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Maen bolia Tu kardi maenu piar
Maen bolia Taenu charhega bukhar
Maen bolia Taenu aundi meri yad
Maen bolia Teri jibh ‘te mera suad
Sirf taenu ajje pata nahi
</div>

<div class="translation">
I said You love me
I said You will get the fever
I said You miss me
I said You can still taste me on your tongue
You just don’t know it yet
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Sun ke meri sun ke meri
Kujh o hil si gai
Kujh der tan chup o rahi
Fir o injh boli
</div>

<div class="translation">
On hearing me on hearing me
She was a bit shaken
She was mum for a while
Then she said this
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Jo kujh vi si maen chahia
Milia uho sab maen paia
Hai pura mera jahan
Ta sunnian das kyon terian akhan
</div>

<div class="translation">
All that I ever coveted
I have it all
My world is complete
Then why tell me, are your eyes empty
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Maen bolia Tere ‘ch khali ik thaan
Na bhar sakey
O koi mere siva
Na lagna ethey ko gulab
Ugna bas ik kanda tikha
Sirf tainu ajje pata nahi
</div>

<div class="translation">
I said There’s a hollow inside of you
It can’t be filled
By anyone but me
No rose is going to grow here
Only a sharp thorn
You just don’t know it yet
</div>


<div class="lyric">
Jandan maen mel hona aukha
Chali jo tu gain eyn us paar
Maen tan bhaven aapne bul si lavan
Par kukdi ey meri guitar
Raatin uthh rondi ey meri guitar
</div>

<div class="translation">
I know a union is hard now
That you’ve crossed over to the other side
I might as well sew my lips
But my guitar it wails
It wakes up at night crying
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Maen kiha ajj shishey nu
“Aa vakhan khan urey kihnu farhia ey tu
Beetia so beet gia
Maenu das vira kahnu arhia ey tun”
Bolia shisha “Maen ki dassan
</div>

<div class="translation">
I told the mirror today
“Show me what you got there
The past is past
Tell me brother why are you still stuck up”
The mirror said “What can I say
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Kujh farhia nahi kujh chhadia nahi
Aunda maenu ik geet hijar da
O vi chhad dian tan fir gavan maen ki”
Maen kiha “Gall mann lai meri
Kal pichhey ajj guavenga tun”
Bolia shisha “Japday jiven
Shiv nu nahi kadey parhia ey tun
Jah taenu kujh pata nahi
</div>

<div class="translation">
Dunno what I have
I know only this song of separation
What else can I sing if not this”
I said “Listen to me
You will lose the present for the past”
Miror said Seems like you haven’t
Ever read Shiv
Go you know nothing
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Maen bolia Tu kardi maenu piar
Maen bolia Taenu charhega bukhar
Maen Bolia Taenu kohu meri yad
Maen Bolia Teri jibh te mera suad
Maen bolia Ro ro hovengi beza
Maen bolia Avengi tu haddan paar
</div>

<div class="translation">
I said You love me
I said You will get the fever
I said My memory will impale you
I said You can taste me on your tongue
I said You’ll breakdown crying
I said You’ll come crossing all lines
</div>

<div class="lyric">
Sirf taenu ajje pata nahi
</div>

<div class="translation">
You just don’t know it yet
</div>
